# RK4_Solver

An implementation of Runge-Kutta Method of order 4 for solving a system of ODEs.

Please see the file [`RK4.c`](./RK4.c) file for a how-to-use.

Edit [`RK4.c`](./RK4.c) for your system of ODEs and then compile and run the program. Results of each iteration are printed to the terminal window.
